# Course assistants

- Course assistants
    - Hannu K채rn채 -- first_name.last_name@helsinki.fi
- Contact via e-mail or the course telegram channel

- Telegram channel https://t.me/tkttiralabra/ (will contain discourse in Finnish)
- Course page https://tiralabra.github.io/2022_p3/en

# What?

- On the course you will implement some program that utilizes "difficult" algorithm(s)/data structure(s) including all of the required data structures and algorithms. Everything included in the prerequisites is considered trivial. Eg. a purely brute force sudoku solver is not a suitable topic.

# Prerequisite knowledge

- Prerequisite knowledge:
    - **Data Structures and Algorithms**
        - Mandatory
    - **Programming techique** (only in Finnish)
        - Very beneficial but the course materials cover the required knowledge in testing and project sturctures
- Ask if:
    - You have done Data Structure and Algorithms but do not have the credit (missing the exam for example)
    - You are unsure about the prerequisite knowledge requirements

# Course content

- The programming language to be used has to be accepted by a course assistant. At least Java and Python will be accepted
    - Ask a course assistant if you prefer some other languages
    - Note that testing and test coverage reporting is required no matter the language
- **Git** version control and **GitHub** is used
- The lab consists of **individual work**
- Generally the product will be some sort of **running program**
    - Not a library or a bunch of code that can not be executed
- Typically progams need to have some sort of **user interface**

# Course content

- Project examples:
    - Comparison of path finding algorithms
    - Data compression algorithms
    - Cryptography
    - Computational creativity: music, text, pictures
    - Game solvers (minesweepers, nonograms, solitaire...)
        - There is a minesweeper template project on git!
    - AI (Chess, Go...)
        - There is a chess template project on git!
- **Try to chose a topic you are personally interested in!**

# Coding style

- The code written for this course should be of high quality and easy to read. You should use some kind of style checkking (e.g. Java Checkstyle)
- The project name should be indicative of the contents. Course assitants will not appreciate it if all the project names are along the lines of "Lab-2020"
- Project structure along the lines of the programming techniques course
    - I.e. not all of the project code should be in the same file/folder
- Good coding conventions like DRY ja Single responsibility should be applied

# Conduct of the course

- **Deadlines** according to the course material
    - Each deadline gives 0-2 points based on the deadline requirements
    - Submissions are done by *pushing* the project state to GitHub
        - No submissions by e-mail
    - A large part of the points -- and the grade -- are based on deadlines and code reviews
    - After each deadline, a course assistant will give some sort of feedback -- more thorough feedback is available through paja, e-mail or Telegram
    - Extra time for deadlines may be available with **good reasons** if asked for **in advance**.


# Conduct of the course

- If you need help, contact the instructor. Personal guidance available in Zoom.
- You may get advice in Telegram too
# Conduct of the course

- A **code review** is done in conjunciton with Deadlines 4 and 5
    - Every student will get another student project to review
    - Students write and receive feedback on each others' projects
    - The intention is to get familiar with reading code written by others
    - It is also important to get feedback 
    - Maximum points for each review is **4**
    - Requirements for grade 5 include making both reviews

# Conduct of the course

- At the end of the course there will be a mandatory **demo session**
    - Each student presents their project for about 10 minutes
    - Every student is present for the entire session
    - The project does not have to be completely done at the demo session
- There is **no course exam**

# Motivation

- This can be one of the most fun courses during Bachelors' studies - you can implement whatever you want!
- If you get stuck, ask a course assitant for help
    - I'm here for you!
- Normally there are no real penalties for dropping courses -- labs are an exception to this
    - It may be harder to enroll to the course after dropping the course

# Ad break

- During fall of 2019 a group of students created 2 new project templates for the lab
    - Chess and
    - Minesweeper
- If either of these subjects are of interest, you may want to check them out. Links can be found on the course page

# Thank you!

- **Welcome to the course!**
- Most information about the course can be found at: https://tiralabra.github.io/2022_p3/en
    - It's a good idea to read through the entire site! **The English course instructions are not up to date. You should read the Finnish course page too.**
